 📸 ImageIQ – Conversational Image Recognition ChatApplication

ImageIQ is an AI-powered chatbot that combines **image recognition** with **natural language processing (NLP)** to allow users to query and understand images through conversational interaction. Built using Python, computer vision models (like ResNet), and NLP APIs (like Google Gemini), this project enables real-time, intelligent analysis of visual content across domains such as **e-commerce**, **education**, and **healthcare**.


🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Image Analysis**: Detects and describes objects, scenes, and text within images.
- 💬 **Conversational Interface**: Text-based chatbot powered by transformer models.
- 🧠 **Context-Aware Responses**: Generates intelligent replies based on both image content and user queries.
- ⚡ **Real-Time Interaction**: Fast processing using Flask-based APIs.
- 📊 **Use Cases**: Educational diagrams, product recommendations, symptom identification, etc.
